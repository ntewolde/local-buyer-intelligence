## Product Overview

### What LocalBI Does

## Value Proposition

### The Problem We Solve

**Home service businesses waste 40-60% of their advertising budget** targeting the wrong geographic areas. They typically:

1. **Spray and Pray** - Advertise everywhere hoping something works
2. **Use Gut Instinct** - Target areas based on assumptions, not data
3. **Copy Competitors** - Go where everyone else goes (oversaturated)
4. **React to Leads** - Only know what worked after spending money

### Why This Matters

| Traditional Approach | With LocalBI |
|---------------------|--------------|
| $5,000/month ad spend | $5,000/month ad spend |
| 40% wasted ($2,000) | 10% wasted ($500) |
| 15 qualified leads | 35 qualified leads |
| $333 cost per lead | $143 cost per lead |
| **$0 saved** | **$1,500 saved + 2.3x more leads** |

### The LocalBI Advantage

1. **Data-Driven Decisions** - Replace guesswork with intelligence
2. **Proactive Targeting** - Find demand before competitors do
3. **ROI Optimization** - Every dollar works harder
4. **Seasonal Planning** - Know when and where demand shifts
5. **Competitive Intelligence** - Understand market saturation

### Return on Investment

**Conservative estimate for a $149/month Pro subscription:**

- Monthly subscription cost: $149
- Average ad budget: $3,000/month
- Typical waste reduction: 30%
- Monthly savings: $900
- **Net ROI: 504%** ($900 - $149 = $751 net gain)

## Sales Objection Handling

### "It's too expensive"

**Response framework:**

1. **Acknowledge:** "I understand budget is important..."
2. **Reframe:** "Let me show you the math..."
3. **Calculate:** "If you spend $X on ads and waste even 20%..."
4. **Close:** "LocalBI pays for itself if it saves you just one bad campaign."

**Example script:**
> "I hear you. Let me ask - what's your monthly advertising budget? [$3,000] So if LocalBI helps you avoid wasting just 10% of that, you'd save $300/month. The Pro plan is $149, so you'd be $151 ahead every single month, plus getting better leads. Does that math work for you?"

### "I already know my market"

**Response framework:**

1. **Validate:** "That's great - experience is valuable..."
2. **Challenge gently:** "When's the last time you analyzed demographic shifts?"
3. **Add value:** "LocalBI doesn't replace your knowledge - it enhances it..."
4. **Offer proof:** "Let me show you a free analysis of your area..."

**Example script:**
> "Your experience is definitely an asset. Here's what I've seen though - neighborhoods change. New developments pop up, demographics shift, competitors move in. LocalBI gives you fresh data to validate what you know and spot opportunities you might have missed. Can I run a quick analysis on your top 5 ZIP codes?"

### "I need to think about it"

**Response framework:**

1. **Understand:** "Of course. What specifically do you want to think through?"
2. **Address the real objection:** (Usually price, timing, or authority)
3. **Create urgency:** "While you're thinking, your competitors might be acting..."
4. **Offer trial:** "How about a 14-day trial so you can think with data in hand?"

### "I tried something like this before"

**Response framework:**

1. **Empathize:** "I'm sorry that didn't work out..."
2. **Differentiate:** "What specifically didn't work? Let me show you how we're different..."
3. **De-risk:** "That's exactly why we offer monthly plans - no long-term commitment..."

### "My nephew does my marketing"

**Response framework:**

1. **Don't dismiss:** "That's great you have someone helping..."
2. **Position as a tool:** "LocalBI would make their job easier..."
3. **Focus on results:** "This gives them the data to prove their campaigns are working..."

## Product Demonstration Guide

### Pre-Demo Checklist

- [ ] Confirm prospect's service category
- [ ] Identify their current service area (ZIP codes)
- [ ] Know their approximate ad budget
- [ ] Understand their biggest marketing frustration
- [ ] Have backup demo environment ready

### Demo Flow (15-20 minutes)

#### 1. Opening (2 minutes)
- Confirm understanding of their business
- Set agenda for the demo
- Ask what success looks like for them

#### 2. Problem Validation (3 minutes)

- Ask about their current targeting approach
- Get them to acknowledge the problem

#### 3. Live Demo (8 minutes)

**Step 1: Service Selection**
> "Let's look at your exact business. I'll select [their service] and enter [their city]..."

**Step 2: Show Heat Map**
> "Here's the demand heat map. See how some areas are bright red while others are almost white? Those red areas have 3-4x the demand potential..."

**Step 3: Drill Into Data**
> "Let's click on this high-demand ZIP code. You can see the Demand Score is 87 - that's excellent. Here's why: household income averaging $95K, 72% homeownership, homes averaging 25 years old..."

**Step 4: Compare to Low-Demand Area**
> "Now look at this area you might have assumed was good. Demand Score of only 34. See the difference? You could be spending the same money in both places but getting completely different results..."

**Step 5: Show Report Export**
> "When you're ready to act, you export a report like this. You can hand this directly to your marketing person or ad agency..."

#### 4. ROI Discussion (3 minutes)
- Calculate their specific potential savings
- Compare to subscription cost
- Address any concerns

#### 5. Close (2-4 minutes)
- Ask which plan fits their needs
- Handle final objections
- Process payment or schedule follow-up

### Key Demo Tips

1. **Use THEIR data** - Always demo with their actual location and service
2. **Let them discover** - Ask "What do you notice?" rather than telling
3. **Connect to money** - Always tie insights back to ad spend
4. **Show the contrast** - High vs. low demand areas make the point
5. **Keep it moving** - Don't get lost in features, focus on value

   ```

2. **Check for port conflicts:**
   ```bash
   # macOS/Linux
   lsof -i :3000
   lsof -i :8000

   # Windows
   netstat -ano | findstr :3000
   netstat -ano | findstr :8000
   ```

3. **Restart Docker services:**
   ```bash
   docker compose down
   docker compose up -d
   ```

   ```

3. **Restart database:**
   ```bash
   docker compose restart postgres
   # Wait 30 seconds, then restart backend
   docker compose restart backend
   ```

#### Issue: Slow performance

**Symptoms:**
- Pages load slowly
- Reports take long to generate

   docker compose exec redis redis-cli FLUSHALL
   ```

#### Issue: Data not updating

- Old data showing in reports
- New ZIP codes not appearing

**Solutions:**

1. **Check Celery worker:**

### Offline Mode

If the customer loses internet connectivity:

- Real-time updates
- External API integrations

**Recommended actions:**
1. Inform customer that cached data is still accessible
